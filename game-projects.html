                        <h3>Game Designer | Writer | UI/UX Designer</h3>
                        <p>I was the game designer, writer, and UI/UX designer for “Ranger & Roger’s Radar Rescue”, a client project for the Naval Surface Warfare Center - Crane Division. The purpose of the game is to gamify aspects of radar basics to train newcomers to the concept through beginner-friendly writing and a comedic tone. I worked on a team of designers and writers to bring this concept to life. We created the initial game design document and developed the world, characters, minigames, and gameplay mechanics. I also designed the UI layout of the game and created a prototype using Figma. The game was divided into different chapters to focus on the seperate parts of a radar. These chapters were detailed using a flowchart method to explain the level, minigame, and quiz section of each chapter to the artists and developers. I wrote the story, minigame, and dialogue for chapter 6 as well as wrote the ending of the game. Then, after the game was complete, I presented the game with the rest of the team at Indianapolis PopCon 2024.</p>

                        <h3>Game Designer | Writer | UI/UX Designer | Sound Designer</h3>
                        <p>I was the game designer, writer, UI/UX designer, and sound designer for “Archer in Training”, a game about shooting arrows at a target to garner the exact score necessary to move on to the next level. The game was designed to be played with a mouse only and to have a short story to propel the gameplay forward. I created the story of playing as an archer in training who needs to prove themselves through trials in order to become a fully fledged archer. After being satisfied with the narrative, I began working on the sound design. This included sourcing free-to-use sounds for the gameplay as well as composing a short soundtrack using FL Studio 21. The sounds are the most responsive aspect of the game as they are the indicator of when the bow is being pulled to shoot an arrow and if the arrow hit the target. The soundtrack includes an energetic menu theme and a quietly tense level theme. I was also able to design the UI using Godot’s built-in interface design tools.</p>
